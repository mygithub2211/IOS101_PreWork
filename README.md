## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
    Facebook
        1. Background color can be changed either light or dark
        2. Messaging and Video Calls through Messenger.
    Spotify
        1. Smart song recommendations (Discover Weekly, Release Radar)
        2. Offline listening
        3. Cross-device syncing
    Notion
        1. Flexible organization (notes, databases, to-do lists)

    The app that I would like to build is called DailyFlow. This is an all-in-one productivity and organization app designed to streamline your daily life. It combines task management, habit tracking, and smart reminders in a single, easy-to-use interface. Key features include:
        1. Smart Task Prioritization: Uses AI to suggest the most important tasks based on deadlines, urgency, and past habits.
        2. Personalized Routines & Habit Tracker: Helps build and maintain positive habits with streaks and gentle reminders.
        3. Integrated Calendar & Notes: Syncs with Google Calendar and lets you take quick notes for meetings, shopping lists, or daily reflections.
        4. AI-Powered Suggestions: Provides daily recommendations, such as the best time to work out, when to take breaks, or how to optimize your schedule.
        5. Quick-Access Widgets & Voice Commands: Allows you to add tasks, set reminders, and check schedules without opening the app.
